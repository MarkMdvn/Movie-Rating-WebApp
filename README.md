## üìã Description

This project is a demonstration of my knowledge of web application development with Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB. It was built utilizing various Spring functionalities and adhering to a full-stack architecture. The primary objective was to create a maintainable and scalable web application that interacts with a NoSQL database.

## üì± Functionalities

* Movie Selection: Users can browse and choose from a variety of movies available in the app.

* Trailer Viewing: After selecting a movie, users can watch the trailer directly within the application, providing a seamless preview experience.

* Review Writing: Users can write and submit reviews for the movies they have watched, sharing their opinions and feedback.

## üì∑ Examples

* All the movies from the 'Home' page of the project are stored in a database:
